NetLogo version 6.1.1, can run on almost all types of computers, as discussed on the NetLogo website. FEWCalc was developed using Microsoft Windows Windows 7 and 10, and macOS Catalina (version 10.15.5). A machine with 64 MB of memory (RAM) is recommended for Windows operating systems. For macOS users, OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.3 or newer is required with 128 MB RAM (258 MB RAM recommended).

## FEWCalc GitHub Repository
To download files, go to https://github.com/JPhetheet/FEWCalc

## **Step 1. Download NetLogo**
FEWCalc is developed using a NetLogo platform as an agent-based model. NetLogo is an open source software which is available at https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo. A screenshot of this site is shown in **Fig. 1.** Click **“Download NetLogo”.** Download NetLogo version 6.1.1 or higher. The download can be placed in any directory on your computer.

## **Step 2. Get FEWCalc From GitHub Repository When You Have NO GitHub Account**
[See **Step 7** if you DO have a GitHub account]

Go to https://github.com/JPhetheet/FEWCalc. You will see the image in **Fig. 2.** This FEWCalc repository includes a Netlogo file and its supporting documents such as input files and figures used in FEWCalc. Click **“Clone or Download”** in the top right corner to get the dropdown menu shown in **Fig. 2.** 

Click **“Download ZIP”** to download FEWCalc. A folder “FEWCalc-master” is saved in a local directory that you choose. Navigate to that directory and unzip the downloaded zip file. Do this by right clicking on the zip file and selecting one of the download options. The exact options available will depend on your computer and available utilities. The FEWCalc directory is shown in **Fig. 3.**

## **Step 3. Launch FEWCalc**
Click or double click (depending on how your computer is set up) “FEWCalc.nlogo” file from FEWCalc-master folder (**Fig. 3**). You will see the image in **Fig. 4** with the square in the middle will be blank.

## **Step 4. SetUp FEWCalc**
Click “SetUp” on the top left to get the image in **Fig. 5.**

<img width="500" alt="Fig5" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47259270/89094130-12898880-d3eb-11ea-9cff-1fecb38bdfa9.png">

**Fig. 5.** FEWCalc interface. 

The user-defined inputs are controlled by the features on the left side of the image shown in **Fig. 5.** This part of the image with the default values defined when FEWCalc is started using the distributed FEWCalc.nlogo file is shown in **Fig. 6.** All features are defined in **Table 1.**

<img width="350" alt="Fig6" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47259270/89094183-5b414180-d3eb-11ea-8060-5fc04618fd3e.png">

**Fig. 6.** FEWCalc user inputs showing default values defined by clicking **“Set up”** when the unchanged distributed file FEWCalc.nlogo is used. 

**Table 1.** FEWCalc user-input features, descriptions, default values imposed each time FEWCalc is started, and the units of those values. Default values are discussed in Appendix A and the main article.

## **Step 5. Run FEWCalc**
If any inputs are changed, click **“Setup”** again before running the program.
Run the program by doing one of the following. 

* Click **“Go once”** to advance the simulation one time step. User inputs can be changed each step of the simulation.
* Or click **“Go”** to run the entire simulation period. The same user inputs are used throughout the simulation 

When the simulation is completed using the default values, FEWCalc will look like **Fig. 7.** The defaults provide results for creating the last 50 years of the simulation by repeating the first 10 historical years five times. Additional future scenarios can be simulated using the “Future Process” drop down menu under “Climate Scenario” section of the input panel.

**Fig. 7.** FEWCalc interface after running the entire defined simulation time of 60 years (top left). This can be accomplished by clicking on **“Go Once”** 60 times, or **“Go”** once (top left).

Annotated images of the central area, which is called the World are shown in **Fig. 8.** 

<img width="500" alt="Fig8" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47259270/89095509-f0970280-d3f8-11ea-8b06-a49a82b9d662.png">

**Fig. 8.** (a) FEWCalc interface and (b) a list of graphical components within the World.

To obtain the results shown in the article for which this section in an appendix, add a Production Tax Credit (PTC) of 30% and rerun FEWCalc.

To save the input file for the altered run, click File at the top left of the NetLogo window, and click Save As. Save the file as, for example. FEWCalc-PTC.30.nlogo. If this file is clicked to start FEWCalc next time, this change will be implemented.

## **Step 6. Advanced Features of FEWCalc**

### 6.1 More Information About FEWCalc
For more information, you can click an Info tab at the top of the program **(Fig. 9).**

<img width="500" alt="Fig9" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47259270/89095541-49669b00-d3f9-11ea-921b-ce6a754e0efb.png">

**Fig. 9.** Info tab.

### 6.2 Additional Parameters That Can Be Changed
Selected parameters are listed at the top of the program under a **Code** tab, as shown in **Fig. 10.** Here, users are able to adjust model inputs such as level of crop insurance coverage, and futures market crop price. These changes will be saved if the project is saved as described at the end of Step 5.

<img width="500" alt="Fig10" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47259270/89095569-964a7180-d3f9-11ea-9e57-74d7c99fbc4c.png">

**Fig. 10.** Parameter values for which value can be changed at the top of the Code.

Additional input can be controlled by the user through CSV files. The file *“9a_Farm_Expenses_For_Users.csv”* can be used to control crop expenses. The file *“10_capital _depreciation.csv”* can be used to control depreciation rates for each year. These files include labels that define the values listed.

### 6.3 Restoring Default Values
A default button is provided in the interface to restore variables defined in the FEWCalc interface to their original values.

For the additional parameters mentioned in Step 6.2, default values can be restored by copying csv files *“9b_Farm_Expenses_Reference.xlsx”* to *“9a_Farm_Expenses_For_Users.csv,”* and *“10b_Capital_depreciation_Reference.xlsx”* to *“10a_Capital_depreciation.csv.”*

For the values listed at the top under the Code tab, any changes from or back to the originally distributed value are controlled by the user.

### 6.4 Saving the nlogo File and Files of Results
Clicking File on the top right of the interface window provides the opportunity to save the nlogo file for future runs and export a range of output files.

CSV files for results from any graph also can be exported by left-clicking on a graph and choosing “Export”. Default files names are assigned and can be changed by the user.

## **Step 7. Getting FEWCalc From GitHub Repository When You DO Have a GitHub Account**
Go to https://github.com/JPhetheet/FEWCalc. This FEWCalc repository includes a Netlogo file and its supporting documents such as input files and figures used in FEWCalc. 

In the top-right corner of the page, click **“Fork”** (**Fig. 11**). Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. The screen will look like that in **Fig. 12.**

<img width="500" alt="Fig11" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47259270/89095668-4f10b080-d3fa-11ea-865a-c59956e1f144.png">

**Fig. 13.** Clone your FEWCalc repository to your machine.

GitHub navigates to your GitHub Desktop. Then, **“Clone a Repository”** window appears automatically as shown in **Fig. 14.**

Define your local directory to store a FEWCalc folder in your machine. 

Repository URL or GitHub and repository
